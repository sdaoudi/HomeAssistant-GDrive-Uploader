# Creating a Google Cloud Project and Service Account for Google Drive API Access

This documentation will guide you through the process of creating a Google Cloud project and a service account with access to a Google Drive directory for using the Google Drive API. By following these steps, you will be able to interact with Google Drive programmatically using the credentials of the service account.

## Step 1: Creating a Google Cloud Project

1. Open the Google Cloud Console: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

2. If you don't have a Google account, sign up for one. Otherwise, log in to your Google Cloud account.

3. Click on the project dropdown at the top of the page and select "New Project."

4. Provide a name for your project and select a billing account. If you don't have a billing account, follow the prompts to set one up.

5. Click on the "Create" button to create your project. Note down the Project ID, as you will need it later.

## Step 2: Enabling the Google Drive API

1. In the Google Cloud Console, click on the navigation menu (â˜°) and go to "APIs & Services" > "Library."

2. Search for "Google Drive API" and click on it.

3. Click the "Enable" button to enable the API for your project.

## Step 3: Creating a Service Account

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials."

2. Click on the "Create credentials" button and choose "Service account."

3. Provide a name for the service account and optionally, a description.

4. Choose a role for the service account. For Google Drive API access, you can start with the "Project" > "Editor" role, which grants broad access to the project resources.

5. Validate the form

7. Edit the new credential

8. Go to Keys tab

9. Add a key and select "JSON" and click on the "Create" button. A JSON file containing the service account key will be downloaded to your computer. This file is crucial, as it will authenticate your service account.

## Step 4: Granting Access to Google Drive

1. Go to your Google Drive account: [https://drive.google.com/](https://drive.google.com/)

2. Create a new directory (folder) or select an existing directory that you want the service account to have access to.

3. Right-click on the chosen directory and click on "Share."

4. In the "Share with people and groups" dialog, enter the email address of the service account (found in the downloaded JSON file) into the "People" field.

5. Set the access level for the service account (e.g., "Editor," "Viewer," or "Commenter").

6. Click on the "Send" button to grant access to the service account.

## Step 5: Using the Google Drive API

You can now use the service account's credentials (JSON key) to access the Google Drive API. Refer to the official Google Drive API documentation for your programming language to get started with API calls.

Make sure to handle the service account key securely, as it provides access to your Google Drive resources.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Google Cloud project, a service account, and granted it access to a Google Drive directory for using the Google Drive API.
